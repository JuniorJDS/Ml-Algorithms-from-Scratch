# Ml-Algorithms-from-Scratch

Machine Learning (ML) is the art and science of teaching machines to do complex tasks without
explicitly programming them. In this repository I want to explore  algorithm without black box.

#### 1) Linear Regression 
#### 2) Decision Tree Regression 
We'll build our own Decision Tree Algorithm to predict House Price and compare with the decision tree from Scikit-learn.
